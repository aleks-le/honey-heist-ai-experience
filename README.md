In 2017, Grant Howitt created and published a beloved one page RPG "Honey Heist" that is available for anyone to play:
https://gshowitt.itch.io/honey-heist.

As AI seeps into our day-to-day life, now you can play this simple campaign endlessly by creating a new adventure that was born from one page.

Created within "Code in Place 2025" course in Stanford.
