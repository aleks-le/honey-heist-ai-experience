# Honey Heist - Endless AI experience

In 2017, **Grant Howitt** created and published a beloved one page RPG **"Honey Heist"** that is available for anyone to play:

As AI seeps into our day-to-day life, now you can play this simple campaign endlessly by creating a new adventure that was born from one page.

Created within "Code in Place 2025" course in Stanford.
